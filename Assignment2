"Using Spatial Lag, Spatial Error and Geographically Weighted Regression to Predict Median House Values in Philadelphia Block Groups"
"The problem being examined in this report is the relationship between median house values (MEDHVAL) and several neighborhood characteristics (# Households Living in Poverty [NBELPOV100], % of Individuals with Bachelorâ€™s Degrees or Higher [PCBACHMORE], % of Vacant Houses [PCTVACANT], % of Single House Units [PCTSINGLES]) in Philadelphia . Philadelphia is a city of diverse neighborhoods and it is important to understand the factors that are associated with differences in median house values across the city. Previous analysis using OLS regression has shown a relationship between median house values and several neighborhood characteristics, but it is possible that some of the spatial autocorrelation between median house values across the city has not been accounted for. In this report, we will use GeoDa and ArcGIS to run spatial lag, spatial error, and geographically weighted regression in order to examine whether these methods can account for spatial autocorrelation that might remain in the OLS residuals. OLS analysis is often inappropriate when dealing with datasets that have a spatial component because it does not properly account for spatial autocorrelation, which is when observations that are near each other in space have similar values. OLS assumes that observations are independent, which is not true in the case of spatial datasets. Therefore, OLS will likely lead to incorrect results and conclusions when dealing with spatial datasets. This report aims to compare the performance of traditional Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression with Spatial Lag, Spatial Error and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models, in order to determine which method is most effective for exploring the spatial relationships between variables."
